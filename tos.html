      <h3>11.1 Maximum Liability</h3>
      <p>To the extent permitted by law, our total liability to you for all claims arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of VoidGifts shall not exceed the amount you have paid to us, if any, in the twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to the liability.

      <h3>11.2 Essential Purpose</h3>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this Section are fundamental elements of the agreement between you and VoidGifts, and VoidGifts would not be able to provide the Service to you without these limitations.</p>
      
      <h3>11.3 Jurisdictional Limitations</h3>
      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages.
